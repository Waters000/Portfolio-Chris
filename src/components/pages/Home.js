      <p>
        Thanks for visiting the portfolio page for Chris Waters.
        I love to write computer code and make fun and interesting website and webapps.  Do you have a fun idea?
        Let's discuss and I can build it for you or we can team up and try to build a new business. Honest and fun people only.
        Please review my portfolio and reach out with any questions.
